# Illumio-Coding-Challenge
Given a 90 minute time frame, I was able to mostly implement the assigned task.
My program assumes valid, well-formed entries as input and was tested on the sample inputs given.

Without modifying the required interface of

accept_packet(String direction, String protocol, int port, String ip_address),

I was able to check any packet except those with a port range. Instead, my program is only capable of checking packets with single ports. I would like to know how it would be possible to deal with port ranges when the function can only accept integers, as this problem had me stumped.

Given more time, I would have used regular expressions to determine if the IP address was valid, as it would be more efficient and would have shortened my code. However, I did not have enough experience with using regular expressions in Java and I was nearly out of time.

I would like to work on the Policy team! Thank you for the opportunity to complete this coding challenge.
